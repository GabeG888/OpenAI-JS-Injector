# OpenAI JS Injector
## Description
This is a Google Chrome extension that modifies the contents of webpages by injecting Javascript with GPT-3.5.
## Warning
This extension runs code generated by a large language model in your browser with no safety measures. Use it carefully, as it could harm your device. This extension never reads the pages you view or any metadata about your usage, but injected Javascript code has access to all of this data and could do anything with it. The creator of this project is not responsible for any harmful results of using this extension.
## Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/GabeG888/openai-js-injector.git` or download ZIP and extract
- Go to chrome://extensions

## How to Use
Click Ctrl+Q or the button in the extensions menu to open the interface. You will be asked for your OpenAI API key the first time.
